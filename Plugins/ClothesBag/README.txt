Clothes Bag Plugin
==================

Installation:
-------------
1. Place the entire "ClothesBag" folder inside your game's Plugins/ directory.

Your directory should look like:

  Plugins/
      ClothesBag/
          ClothesBag.rb
          README.txt

2. Open Pokémon Essentials.
3. Make sure that:
     - An item named CLOTHESBAG exists (Key Item).
     - Outfit trainer sprites exist in Graphics/Trainers:

         POKEMONTRAINER_Garth.png
         POKEMONTRAINER_Amy.png
         POKEMONTRAINER_Garth_1.png
         POKEMONTRAINER_Amy_1.png
         ...
         POKEMONTRAINER_Garth_8.png
         POKEMONTRAINER_Amy_8.png
